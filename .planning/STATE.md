# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** A team of customer success agents can manage a portfolio of DSOs within one organization, with admins controlling who has access to which DSOs
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Database Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Database Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped, ready for Phase 1 planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Arch]: Service_role + application-level auth throughout — NOT RLS-first. All 31 routes use supabaseAdmin; new org routes follow the same pattern. RLS-first is a future separate milestone.
- [Arch]: Org stored in context/localStorage — NOT in URL segments. Avoids refactoring all 31 route fetch calls for this milestone.
- [Constraint]: Zero-downtime required — user_dso_access must stay in place until ALL 31 routes are verified on the new org model (Phase 5).
- [Risk]: Existing invite bug (inviter's ALL DSOs granted on invite) must be fixed in Phase 3 BEFORE building org-scoped invites, or it becomes a cross-org data leak.
- [Risk]: ADD COLUMN NOT NULL on live dsos table requires three-step pattern: add nullable → backfill → constrain separately.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 5 pre-work**: 31 routes need individual audit before Phase 5 planning — complexity varies. Research flags this as needing a route inventory pass. Flag for plan-phase to address.
- **Open product decision**: Does org membership grant access to all DSOs in the org, or does per-DSO access control (user_dso_access) remain permanent? If permanent, Phase 5 is more nuanced. Resolve before Phase 5 planning begins.
- **Local Supabase**: Confirm local Supabase is running and migrations apply cleanly before Phase 1 execution begins (per CLAUDE.md requirements).
- **Valentina cleanup**: Valentina has erroneous access to all 5 DSOs. Address during data migration in Phase 1.
